        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Alyssa Vasquez and I am an 18-year-old female attending the University of California Riverside as a first-year Pre-Business major. I'm working on getting my degree in Business Management or maybe even possibly Business Marketing. I graduated my High-School with honors roll and I intend on being just as successful during my college years. During college, I'm looking to possibly find an internship with a company in the fashion or beauty industry, so that way when I do graduate I will have work experience as well as something to add to my growing resume. In my last final two years of college, I am hoping and saving money to live out the life of an international student and study abroad for either a quarter or the whole year. I currently do not have any work experience, but I am fully open to any opportunities that may come my way. <br><br>

        I found my passion for beauty and fashion at a very young age. Growing up around a family of mainly all girls, I was surrounded by the endless supply of makeup and clothes. Having this spark in my young mind, I knew that this would be a growing passion that would stick with me for life. As I grew older, my love for the beauty industry only grew and influenced who I am today. With social media being one of the biggest growing industries, social media influencers came along and changed the game for everyone. I saw how successful these influencers are and thought that when I get older I would love to do something within the field of Business. Seeing how big the Business industry is, it is also very competitive and filled with people with creative and innovative mindsets. I used to have a dream of opening up my own hair salon but later realized that I would much rather work for a business within an industry I am very interested in.  <br><br>

        As the years go by, I am still learning and finding what paths I would want to take in life, whether it is opening up my own business, working for a large industry and stick with that for life, or even work for a business that also lets me travel around the world while working and doing what I love. Life is pretty scary and there is always that constant feeling of fear that you may not be successful in life, but I've learned that no one can tell you that you are not successful if you are doing what makes you happy. So many people live to work, and I would much rather work to live, so I can live how I want to, follow my dreams, and share my knowledge with others, because knowledge is only valuable if it is being passed along to the world. With this being said, I plan on continuing my college career with an open mindset to whatver God has planned for me. I'm constantly learning and growing educationally, emotionally, and spiritually. I hope to not only live out my own personal dreams, but also be that person that impacts some else's life in whatever way it may be. In conclusion, do what makes you feel happy and don't ever feel guilty for putting yourself first.
